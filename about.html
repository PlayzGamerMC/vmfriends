			<h2>ABOUT</h2>
			<h3>We started this group out in February. The first group name was "Adakad". 
			<br>
			It was a language made by our friends.
			Then, we changed it to the VM Friends 
			<br>
			because a few people weren't a part of that language,
			but wanted to be in the group.
			<br>
			We had many fights in the group on being Admin and making others users but 
			<br>
			then we settled to one decision and nobody won the fight. 
			We also created a "Rulebook" 
			<br>
			for the group which we will link down below.
			We annoyingly had to change the name 
			<br>
			"The Friends" because our friend, "TheCricketerFan", added his coding buddy,
			<br>
			the "WearyFern". There was a lot of war between "TheCricketerFan" and "The WearyFern"
			<br>
			even though they were "coding buddies".
			They didn't get along well in the end. Since,
			<br>
			he left and all the other members in the group were studying in VM or had previously 
			<br>
			studied in VM, we changed the name of the group to "The VM Friends". After naming 
			<br>
			it the VM Friends, we 
			had some pretty weird stuff going on like random people who we 
			<br>
			don't even know joining thanks to the "Invite Link".</h3>
